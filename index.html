					<h1> ABOUT Age Of Garb </h1>
					<h2>Goals and Motivation</h2>
					In this project, we wanted to achieve a well functioning and fun AR game that let 
					players take control over a drone using their phone to interact with an 
					environment that was placeable on a surface. The goal was to create a playable 
					field that would not be limited to a small surface such as a table or a set 
					range on the ground. Instead we wanted the player to be able to define the size 
					of the scene before they played in order to truly utilize the most of the 
					potential available open space for the player. We spent some time to refine 
					this idea during the development process and ended up with the final project. 
						
					<h2>Technologies</h2>
					Unity <br>
					AR-Core <br>
					GitHub
					
					<h2>Contributions</h2>
					The project contributes graphics wise by displaying a resizeable playing 
					surface on a selectable plane. The player scans their environment and then 
					select exactly where the playing area should be located. To avoid scaling down 
					the area in unity which would make some implementation code break, the 
					placeable play area is actually never resized at all. Instead a script is placed 
					on the camera which makes it look like the placeable area is really small, 
					when in reality, the camera is placed really far away. 
					<br><br>
					The advanced interaction contribution for this project comes in two parts. 
					Firstly, you can control the playable drone character by actually moving the 
					camera though physical space. By simple moving closer to the play area, 
					the playable character is moved closer as well, which makes the players mobile 
					screen a first person view perspective.<br>
					The second interaction contribution is the trash-can ficons. When 
					these trash cans are scanned by the mobile phone, the player manually place 
					them where the physical ficon is placed. This allows the player to configure 
					the placements of the trash cans which affects how the game is played.
					
					<h2>Challenges and Obstacles</h2>
					We face multiple challenges with this project that we overcame in the end. One 
					big challenge was that the game code broke down when using small scales for the 
					play area. Which was significant since the scaling of the playable area is a 
					main goal for this project. In the end this issue was solved by placing a script
					on the camera which makes it look like the placeable area is really small, 
					when in reality, the camera is placed really far away.

					<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
					A lot of things were learned by the team for this project. One such thing was 
					that sometimes it is necessary to radically the idea of the project in order 
					to finish it in time. This was something we had to do multiple times though the
					development cycle of the project. We also learned that a lot of work is done 
					quickly if you meet up as a group and work together in the same place.
					A shared work space facilitates communication greatly and helps with the 
					planning and development of most projects. Another thing we learned is that it 
					is fine to change something if it's not working, even if you think it is too late.
					For example, during the open house event, we quickly realized that the table 
					set-up that we used was not good for showing off the main features of the game.
					Therefore we changed it on the spot, and it worked out fine.

							<h2>Natalie Axelsson</h2>
							My main responsibilities were 3D-modeling and 3D-printing. For example, 
							I created all models related to the trash, and I 3D-printed trash cans 
							that can be scanned in the game. I also worked on procedural 
							genereation of the levels, mostly on the tree placement and the 
							randomized appearance of the trash piles.

							<h2>Rodrigo Retuerto</h2>
							 I was responsible for the procedural generation within this project. 
							 This consists of placement and properties of the main buildings and 
							 all the objects( trees, floor, lights, roads, etc) within the scene. 
							 This was done using procedural generation so that the user can have 
							 a new level each time making the experience a bit more fun. Because 
							 the generated level is the centre between our components(AR, AI, etc) 
							 I also helped create the bindings and put them together.

							<h2>Alvaro Ortega Mattsson</h2>
							I was responsible for the animations and the AI of the NPC's. 
							This includes, adding already existing animations as well as altering 
							some animations, e.g. when they walk with the trash bag over their 
							shoulder and when they throw it in the trash can. I used Unity's 
							animation system Mechanim to control the different states of the 
							animations as well as some of the AI behavior. A large part of the 
							AI implementation was the path finding of the NPC for when they 
							where walking towards the trash cans and running back home, in which 
							I used Unity's NavMesh functionality. I also worked on spawning the 
							NPC's at random locations and using random character meshes among 
							other things.

							<h2>Tom Axblad</h2>
							I was the project leader for this project. Which means that I delegated 
							all work for all the other team members. I was also responsible for the 
							project repository and all issues, comments, pull requests, version 
							control, and project planning. <br>
							When issues arrived when merging the work from multiple group members, 
							it was my job to tweak them to make sure that stuff was integrated 
							correctly.<br>
							I also made the website you are looking at right now!

							<h2>Edin Suta</h2>
							I was a general gameplay programmer in this project, responsible for 
							various gameplay systems such as the shooting mechanics, projectile 
							logic, a paint splatter system (decal system optimized for mobile 
							platforms, since Unity doesn't support decals for non-HDRP projects)  
							and some minor UI visuals.<br>
							I was also responsible for all of the music and sound effects in the 
							game. I programmed an audio manager for the game which would manage 
							all of the audio collectively and make it easy to tweak and customize 
							each audio effect or soundtrack that would be triggered. 
							This audio manager was easy to import into any other script in order to 
							easily instance and trigger any sound effects from any piece of game 
							logic (and stop or pause instances when they are no longer needed).

							ground. I have also worked on parts of the UI and game state system.
